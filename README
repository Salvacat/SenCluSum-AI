SenCluSumAI
This repository contains code to preprocess, analyze, cluster, and summarize customer reviews from a dataset. The code is structured to be executed sequentially across different Python files, from 00_data_preprocessing to 03_mistral_summarizer.

Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project can be found here. The data contains customer reviews for various products.

Project Structure
The project consists of four main Python scripts, which should be executed in order:

00_data_preprocessing:

This script merges and preprocesses the dataset.
Outputs a cleaned dataset, ready for analysis.
01_sentiment_analysis:

This script uses the outcome of the preprocessing step to fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis.
Saves the fine-tuned BERT model.
Performs sentiment analysis on the reviews and generates sentiment scores.
02_cluster_sbert:

Uses the sentiment-analyzed data from 01_sentiment_analysis to perform clustering using Sentence-BERT (SBERT)(all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Clusters reviews into groups and counts how frequently unique products appear in each cluster.
Outputs clustered data with product counts.
03_mistral_summarizer:

Based on the clusters generated in 02_cluster_sbert, this script assigns category names to clusters.
The user can choose a category, and the script picks the top 3 products from that category.
For each product, the model generates a title and summarizes the reviews for the user.
How to Run

Run the scripts in order:

Start with preprocessing:

bash
Copy code
python 00_data_preprocessing.py
Then run the sentiment analysis:

bash
Copy code
python 01_sentiment_analysis.py
Perform clustering:

bash
Copy code
python 02_cluster_sbert.py
Finally, generate product titles and summaries:

bash
Copy code
python 03_mistral_summarizer.py
Project Dependencies
Python 3.7+
The required Python libraries are listed in the Requirements.txt file.

Conclusion
This project combines sentiment analysis and clustering to categorize and summarize customer reviews. It uses state-of-the-art models like BERT and Sentence-BERT to process the reviews and generate meaningful summaries and product titles based on user input.

P.S: This is a work in progress and part of my AI learning journey. You can see the results in the top_products_summaries.txt for reference of the current status and quality of the output.
